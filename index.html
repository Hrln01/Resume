              I worked closely with many knowledgeable colleagues and gained much insight into multiple areas. Key lessons that are translatable everywhere include the respect for following procedures, how people may conduct themselves in and out of work environments, and the benefits of being dedicated to a task or work in general. 
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
            As an apprentice, I wasn't expected to do much; the people I worked with were knowledgeable but had no care if I actively worked as long as I did the bare minimum, and it was up to me to prove myself.

              Thus, I would initiate a lot of the learning, asking to tag along if there were jobs open. If there wasn't, I would clean the warehouse, take apart circuit breakers, and learn Arduino.

          <p class="mt-4">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Today I am here to explain why I would relish this opportunity and why I am the right choice.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            I possess all the standard qualities you would seek: strong communication skills, adaptability, professionalism, and intelligence. However, what truly distinguishes me is my unrelenting drive to succeed. I firmly believe, as I trust you do, that the key to any success in sales is an innate hunger—a delusional ambition that outweighs all else, as all other requirements of a role are easily attainable after this.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4"><strong>My Story:</strong></p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            I was raised very old school, under the roof of a disciplined salesman; in hindsight I am lucky. It was a given that I have ventures spanning over a decade, starting with classic lemonade stands, selling crystals and toys at school, and lolly hustling in high school, then onto e-commerce and B2B wholesale shortly after; I’ve been immersed in this culture for a long time.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            My most noteworthy success was in the Fast-Moving-Consumable-Goods. In early 2022, starting with a mere $400, I gradually learned through sheer experience; the whole life cycle of a sale in great detail, and many critical aspects of business, most importantly the art of hustle—from direct-to-consumers and later onto B2B partnerships. Over time, I eventually touched weekly revenue that saw over $50,000, achieving this through B2B channels and thousands of independent consumers.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Nearing the regulatory changes on Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, of course, I knew there would be a massive void in the market; after careful consideration and research on any new regulatory changes, I pivoted. Very quickly, I saw over $25,000 in sales a week after a period of limbo, primarily through B2B channels. It wasn’t the same money, but it was the best option at that time; I was simply happy to have found an alternative.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            It was a truly great experience having these distribution businesses; I also gained insight into the inner workings of other businesses I sold to. Everyone’s interconnected; be fair, make them feel special, connect, and with a decent product, it can spread like wildfire within their own network. I became the largest importer and distributor in Western Australia and had people reaching out from NSW and Sydney.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            I acknowledge the controversy of the nicotine industry but hope we can see this as a reflection of a proactive approach to seizing rare opportunities in an already very limited space for a 20-year-old. I am now committed to channelling extraordinary ambition into a respected profession. I only operated in both businesses while they had the framework that meant it could be sold legally as an NRT product.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            I may not come from a traditional background, but I do have a fire to win, and I’ve got a history of experience to back it up—this makes me uniquely qualified. I won’t be there to clock in and out; I will be there to push boundaries and drive growth. I can and will adapt quickly, master my responsibilities, and let my work consume my mind.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            I look forward to hearing from you.
